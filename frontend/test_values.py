About Us

GPT Integrators is a forward-thinking tech company helping businesses leverage the power of AI for real-world impact. We design and implement smart, scalable AI business solutions—from real-time chatbots and LLM-based automations to intelligent backend systems that transform how teams work.

Our mission is to create AI tools that are not only intelligent but deeply useful. We serve clients across healthcare, finance, legal, logistics, and more—merging strategy, software, and cutting-edge AI into solutions that just work.

Position Overview

We’re looking for an exceptional intern—someone who’s not just “interested in AI,” but who already lives and breathes it. You’ll work directly with company leadership to build out intelligent automation, integrate GPT-based tools into client systems, and develop new AI-powered business solutions from the ground up.

This internship is deeply hands-on. You won’t be watching from the sidelines—you’ll be designing, building, and shipping from day one. Expect real ownership and the chance to prove yourself through high-impact work.

Ideal Candidate Profile

You’re a builder. You’ve likely experimented with AI APIs on your own, created small projects outside of class, or contributed to open-source work. You’re not just interested in how AI works—you want to put it to use. You're also someone who values thoughtful design, writes clean code, and likes solving real life problems through tech.

What You’ll Work On

Develop and deploy real-world AI-powered tools (not just proof-of-concepts)

Build and improve web apps, scripts, or dashboards powered by LLMs

Integrate AI into existing business systems via APIs and backend services

Help shape and structure knowledge bases or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) flows

Collaborate with internal teams and directly with clients

 

The best-performing interns may be offered part-time or full-time compensated roles after the internship concludes.
