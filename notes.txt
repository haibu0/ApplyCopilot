Cool AI Implementations:

- Analyze users mood to curate them a poem

- Give readers quick “pop-ups” of background info—why Frost wrote “Stopping by Woods,” or what “daffodils” symbolized for Wordsworth.

- What: Show a little chart (via matplotlib) of sentiment scores per line or stanza—peaks of joy, dips of sorrow. Like a little dropdown dashboard

- What: After you analyze the poem, generate a custom “cover image” that evokes its mood or keywords. How: Send key phrases (“snowy evening,” “dark woods”) to DALL·E or Stable Diffusion via an API, display the returned image.

- Interactive Chatbot Companion: Embed a chat widget where users can ask questions (“Why does Frost repeat ‘miles to go’?”) and get AI-driven responses.

- Poem Generation & Remixing

What: Give users a “Create your own stanza” feature: they enter a couple of lines and the AI completes the poem in the same style.
